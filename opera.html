      "The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No. 7863. The Poor Wit and the Rich
      Councillor.
    </p>

    <p class="speech point">
      A certayne poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed councillor.
      'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor, 'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the
      poor wag, 'in that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither away,
      and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed hugely, and gave him a
      sausage." Humph! the councillor was easier to please than my new master
      the Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that councillor.

      must needs turn to Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!

      Ha! friend jailer! Jailer that wast— jailer that never shalt be more!
      Jailer that jailed not, or that jailed, if jail he did, so unjailery that
      'twas but jerry-jailing, or jailing in joke— though no joke to him who, by
      unjailerlike jailing, did so jeopardise his jailership.

      Come, take heart, smile, laugh, wink, twinkle, thou tormentor that

      Aye, it's well for thee to laugh. Thou hast a good post, and hast cause to
      be merry.

      Cause? Have we not all cause? Is not the world a big butt of humour, into
      which all who will may drive a gimlet? See, I am a salaried wit; and is
      there aught in nature more ridiculous? A poor, dull, heart-broken man, who
      must needs be merry, or he will be whipped; who must rejoice, lest he
      starve; who must jest you, jibe you, quip you, crank you, wrack you,
      riddle you, from hour to hour, from day to day, from year to year, lest he
      dwindle, perish, starve, pine, and die! Why, when there's naught else to
      laugh at, I laugh at myself till I ache for it!

      Aye, I have a pretty wit— a light, airy, joysome wit, spiced with anecdotes
      of prison cells and the torture chamber. Oh, a very delicate wit! I have
      tried it on many a prisoner, and there have been some who smiled. Now it
      is not easy to make a prisoner smile. And it should not be difficult to be
      a good jester, seeing that thou are one.
